#SNAKE GAME
Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. The game consists of a snake that moves around the game board and grows by eating randomly generated food. The player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys and the game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

Features
Responsive game board that adapts to the screen size.
Smooth snake movement and collision detection.
Randomly generated food that gives points to the player.
Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer and moves faster.
Sound effects for eating and game over events.
How to Play
To play the game, open the index.html file in a web browser. The game board and snake will be displayed, and the player can use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. The score is displayed on the top-left corner of the screen.

Technologies Used
HTML5 canvas for rendering the game board and elements.
JavaScript for game logic and user input handling.
CSS for styling the game board and elements.
