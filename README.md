Sound effects for eating and game over events
How to Play
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The game board and snake will be displayed, and the player can use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. The score is displayed on the top-left corner of the screen.
